# 24787_FinalProject_TransferValue
Project - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Engineers 24-787 Carnegie Mellon University Fall 2022

# Goal:
The goal of this project is to use Feature Engineering and Machine learning techniques to predict the values of 
Football (Soccer) players using the dataset of Fifa.

# Dataset:
Dataset taken from Sofifa.com
Used Fifa 20 player data for POC but can use any such dataset

# Overview:
1. Extracting dataset
2. Used Feature Engineering to get most important and relevant features
3. Used Machine Learning Regression models like Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, etc. to benchmark 
best possible algorithm

# Usage:
Execute Jupyter Notebook with provided dataset or otherwise with a csv file of your own

# Future Scope:
1. Incorporating real life data from Transfermarkt
